Work for my final project at Berklee.

Generative Audio/Visual System using Csound and Processing, communicating via OSC.

This project requires the user to have python, csound6, and Processing installed on their computer.

In Processing, you need to install "processing-java", which can be done from the Tools menu.
Flux also requires you to have the netp5 and oscp5 libraries for Processing, 
which can be found here: http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/

After downloading, run the included shell script: sh script.sh

The performance should begin there.
